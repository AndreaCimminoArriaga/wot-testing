Online systems and examples available for testing.

### Frameworks

* [Thingweb node-wot](https://github.com/eclipse/thingweb.node-wot)

* [Test Thing from node-wot](http://plugfest.thingweb.io:8083/TestThing)
  * Always online instance of a Thing that has various payload types
* Virtual Coffee Machine instances from TUM
  * [List of HTTP TDs](http://129.187.45.174:8080)
  * [List of CoAP TDs](coap://129.187.45.174:5683)

### Installable Examples

* [wotify](https://wotify.org/)
  * This is a collection of existing open-source WoT devices. There are also TDs (or TD templates) for closed source devices such as Philips Hue
