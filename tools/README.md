# WoT Testing
## Tools
Tools and systems for testing WoT Things and systems and for 
tracking data associated with testing.
Testing includes conformance testing as well as other forms
of testing, such as interoperability.

* [ThingWeb Playground](playground/README.md)
   Check a TD for conformance with the 
   [WoT Thing Description](https://www.w3.org/TR/wot-thing-description/) specification.
   Can be used as a CLI tool or via an online system.
   * [Online instance](http://plugfest.thingweb.io/playground/)
   * [Github repo](https://github.com/thingweb/thingweb-playground)
* [WoT TestBench](testbench/README.md)
   Generates network interactions to test a Thing given a TD.
   * [Github repo](https://github.com/tum-esi/testbench)
* [Implementation Report Generator](implreportgen/README.md)
   * Given various data files (expressed using CSV) generated by other 
     tools or manually entered, generate reports for evaluating conformance
     and interoperability.
* [Thing Simulator](https://github.com/tum-esi/virtual-thing)
   * Given a TD, generates a simulated Thing with the described interactions.
