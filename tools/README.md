# WoT Testing

## Tools

Tools and systems for testing WoT Things and systems and for 
tracking data associated with testing.
Testing includes conformance testing as well as other forms
of testing, such as interoperability.
To make it easier to use CLI tools they can be set up as [github submodules](https://github.blog/2016-02-01-working-with-submodules/).

* [ThingWeb Playground](playground/README.md)
  * Check a TD for conformance with the 
     [WoT Thing Description](https://www.w3.org/TR/wot-thing-description/) specification.
     Can be used as a CLI tool or via an online system.
  * [Online instance](http://plugfest.thingweb.io/playground/)
  * [Github repo](https://github.com/thingweb/thingweb-playground)
    * This repo is checked out recursively here for the purpose of running automated validation scripts.
* [WoT TestBench](testbench/README.md)
  * Generates network interactions to test a Thing given a TD.
  * [Github repo](https://github.com/tum-esi/testbench)
* [Implementation Report Generator](implreportgen/README.md)
  * Given various data files (expressed using CSV) generated by other 
     tools or manually entered, generate reports for evaluating conformance
     and interoperability.
* [Thing Simulator](https://github.com/tum-esi/shadow-thing)
  * Given a TD, generates a simulated Thing with the described interactions.
  * It can also be deployed as a proxy to translate protocols or can cache property values to handle the load of a constrained device.

* [W-ADE: WoT API Development Environment](https://github.com/tum-esi/wade)
  * Similar to Postman, it allows sending requests to WoT devices. However, it parses TDs and generates a UI automatically and supports HTTP, CoAP and MQTT. Based on Thingweb node-wot

* [Online Plugfest VPN](vpn/README.md)
  * VPN configuration instruction for the online plugfest.
