# Testfest
To focus *completely* on testing and completing the Implementation Reports with a focus on Discovery and TD testing.

Note that the Profile spec will still be "mutable".  While we might prototype some tests we will defer detailed testing of Profiles to another
Testfest in mid-July (to be organized).

We also need to focus on gaps where features are at risk.
