# Testfest
To focus *completely* on testing and completing the Implementation Reports for *all* deliverables.
Note that the Profile spec will still be "mutable" but we will still focus on testing assertions
in an actual draft as opposed to proposing completely new items.
We also need to focus on gaps where features are at risk.
