# Example Input File for Discovery Testing

- `manual.csv`: manual assertions
- `auto.csv`: automatic test results (only assertions NOT in `manual.csv`)

To set up Results file,
these should be combined by concatentation of data rows,
and a file put into Results named after the implementation (in this case, `intel-dir.csv`).
