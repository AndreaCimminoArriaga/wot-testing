# Oct 2022 Testfest + Plugfest - WoT Profile
This combined testfest + plugfest is to evaluate implementations of the WoT Profile specification and to identify potential 
out of the box interoperability problems.
The goal is to ensure that the current draft of the WoT Profile Specification https://github.com/w3c/wot-profile is implementable
and satisfies the requirements.
A secondary goal is to identify feature coverage and at risk features for the Implementation Report.

Tuesday and Wednesday will focus on validation of TDs for Profile compliance. The other 2 days will be focused on testing implementations. 

Note: this is a WoT IG event.  We can have contributors who are not WoT members but they have to be
invited as IG guests.  However, this is only the case if they are contributing to the Implementation report,
e.g. with an Implementation Description, targeting the CR candidate deliverables, etc.  Experimental
implementations that do not contribute to the test results should be deferred to the next *plugfest*.

### Contribution to Profiles specification
  - Provide the TDs of your implementation of the Profile specification at https://github.com/w3c/wot-testing/tree/main/data/input_2022/Profiles. 
    You need to group them under your implementation name, like `intel-nodejs/TDs`. These TDs will be used to generate the automatic results.
  - Fill in the [manual.csv](https://github.com/w3c/wot-testing/blob/main/events/2022.09.Online/Profile/manual.csv) for the Profile specification 
    and submit it there. This file is needed for the manual results. This file should go in the folder of your implementation.
