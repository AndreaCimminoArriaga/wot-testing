# Plugfest preparation for TPAC2017

# 1. Introduction

This document describes the information related to the next plugfest in Sunnyvale and demonstration in TPAC, Burlingame in November.

## 1.1 Backgroud

In the past plugfest, we've already checked consistency of the interfaces of two Servients provided by different members. They were combinations of application and device, or device to device. These application and devices were compatible to WoT and talked with it.
To setup a larger scale system, the gateawy functions are required to connect multiple applications and devices located on the different places. Since some Servients may be connected to the local network and the others to the Internet, new issues for these connections should be considered such as security, firewall and NAT, device management and so on. This plugfest will be good opportunity to new issues to resoluve in the future in WoT-WG.

## 1.2 Use case

The drawing below is an use case for the next plugfest. This is the smarthome application that the application on the smartphone can control the air conditioner in the house. The agent and the gateway have gateway functions that connects with applications, devices, and gateways.

# 2. Servients

## 2.1 4-layered Servients

3 types of WoT Servients was derived from the use case described in 1.2. These are defined below:  
* Device Servient: WoT Servient with Exposed Thing, e.g. devices
* Application Servient: WoT Servient with Consumed Thing, e.g. applications
* Proxy Servient: WoT Servient with both Exposed and Consumed Thing, e.g. gateways

The Proxy Servient are seperated to 2 types fo them, Remote Proxy and Local Proxy. The Remote Proxy Servient is deployed on the Internet and connected with the Applicationd Serivent and the Local Proxy Servient. The Local Proxy Servient is done on the Local network and connects with the Remote Proxy Servient and the Device Servient. The layered diagram is shown below.

## 2.3 Servients from plugfest participants

The following figure shows diagrams of Servients that the participants provide for the plugest. 

![Servients](images/Servients_TPAC2017r2.png)

# 3. Plugfest scenarios
The demonstration on TPAC will be separated to 2 parts. The first part is the main to show the over view and some features of Web of Things in a single session. The second part is additional demonstrations from some participants in parallel sessions if needed.

## 3.1 main part 

### 3.1.1 Scenario 1
Remote application servients connect to each Remote proxy and device servient. Each participant setup and check the behavior before the connections. 

![Scenario](images/PlugfestScenario1.png)

### 3.1.2 Scenario 2
A remote proxy servient can accept request from an application and operate local devices via a local proxy servient. The remote proxy has a Thing directory that keeps the TDs corresponding to all devices. The application can get the TD from it.

![Scenario](images/PlugfestScenario2.png)

### 3.1.3 Scenario 3
Local application servients connect to each local proxy and device servient.

![Scenario](images/PlugfestScenario2.png)

## 3.2 additional part

## 3.2.1 Scenario 1: Smart Alarm System
[overview] When a motion sensor associated with one or
more still cameras is triggered,
the camera takes a picture and sends it to a person detection compute service running on a local gateway.
If the person detection service detects a person and the alarm is armed, an alert (buzzer + light) goes on
and stays on until the alert is cancelled.
The various controls (buttons, sensors, lights, etc) are all individual Things.

[proposer] Michael McCool, Intel

[servients] The servients provided are:
* Light - used for status (2x): armed on/off, alert on/off.  OCF/CoAP (from OCF Smart Home Demo)
* Button - used for control (2x): armed/disarm, cancel alert.  OCF/CoAP (from OCF Smart Home Demo)
* Person - analyse image, indicate if a person is present.  Compute service (virtual Thing) running on gateway.
Custom HTTPS-based service, implemented using node-wot scripting wrapper around Caffe CNN.
* Buzzer - used for alarm (1x): alert.  OCF/CoAP (from OCF Smart Home Demo)
* Camera - take still image (nx): custom web service.  Can take JPEG image when polled.
* Motion - detect motion near camera (nx): OCF/CoAP (from OCF Smart Home Demo)
* Alarm - application logic (1x): virtual Thing running on gateway implementing alarm system logic.

Note that the Thing Descriptions for the OCF devices above will be generated by an OCF/WoT metadata bridge.
However, other devices are expected to talk to the OCF devices directly using information in the TD.
There will also be a OCF/HTTP bridge running so the OCF devices can be connected to via either HTTP or CoAP.

## 3.2.2 Scenario 2: Voice Control
[overview] Support generic voice control for all semantically annotated Things.
AVS adapter (running in AWS cloud) will access TDs from Thing directory and map iot.schema.org semantic tags to 
Alexa Home Skill semantics.  All Things so annotated will then be controllable and observable from an
Echo device.

[proposer] Michael McCool, Intel

[servients] All tagged devices.  In addition, the AVS adapter will read in TDs and can be considered to be
a "consuming" servient (running in the cloud).

# Appendix A: Inter-Servient interface

Appendix A describes sequence diagram among application, remote / local proxies, and device servient implemented for this plugfest by Fujitsu. First of all, A1 is preconditions for this sequence diagram, which are structure of servients and their URL for examples.
A2 and A3 describe sequence diagrams and message formats exchanged between servients. Both cases support firewall and NAT traversal between remote and local proxies, which bridges local networks and the Internet. NAT traversal technologies are STUN for A2 and WebScoket for A3.

## A1. Preconditions

### A1.1 Use Case
One or more URLs are assigned to the servients to enable to be access from remote and local servients. URLs described in the figure below are used in the following sequence diagrams and message formats for the examples.

![images](images/UseCaser1.png)

### A1.2 Things directories on proxy servients
The figure shows below is a directory structure for management of things in a servient. This example is the thing directory for the remote proxy servient “remoteProxy”, Base URL for the remote proxy servient. 

![images](images/ThingDirStructure.png)

## A2. Sequence diagrams

Section A2 shows sequence diagram and message formats exchange among servients which protocol is only HTTP to be used in this sequence. The remote and local proxies bridges with STUN for NAT traversal.

### A2.1 Register
A device servient is registered to the local proxy servient and remote proxy servient. The proxy servient returned the TD with public URL. The proxy servients have TD repositories to store TDs registered from the other servients.

![images](images/seq_register.png)

*Example: using HTTP*

(1) HTTP POST http://lps.example.com/Things/register<BR>
Body: TD<BR>
(2) 201 Created<BR>

(3) (1) HTTP POST http://lps.example.com/Things/register<BR>
Body: TD<BR>

(4) 201 Created<BR>

## A2.2 Lookup
An application servient can lookup TDs registered the remote proxy servient with its URL. If the URL indicates the servient, it returns the list of the devices connected. If the URL specifies the devices registered on the proxy servient, it returns TD of it.

![images](images/seq_lookup.png)

*Example: using HTTP*

(11) HTTP GET http://rps.example.com/Things/<BR>
Body: none<BR>

(12) 200 OK<BR>
Body: list of registered things [FujitsuAirConditioner, PanasonicAirConditioner, …]<BR>

(13) HTTP GET http://rps.example.com/Things/deviceName<BR>
Body: none<BR>

(14) 200 OK<BR>
Body: TD

## A2.3 Get property
The application servient sends a request to get the value of the property of the device servient to the remote proxy servient. The remote and local proxy servient relay to this request to the device servient.

![images](images/seq_getproperty.png)

*Example: using HTTP*

The application gets a value of a certain property of the device servient. For this purpose, it gets the URL for the property from TD of the device servient.

(21) HTTP GET http://rps.example.com/lps1/Things/deviceName/Property/temperature<BR>
Body: none<BR>

The remote proxy gets the URL for the property from TD of the device servient registered in the repository. "glps.example.com" is global address which can be accessed from remote proxy.

(22) HTTP GET http://glps.example.com/Things/deviceName/Property/temperature<BR>
Body: none<BR>

The local proxy gets the URL for the property from TD of the device servient registered in the repository.

(23) HTTP GET http://192.169.1.2/Things/deviceName/Property/temperature<BR>
Body: none<BR>

(24) 200 OK<BR>
Body: 25(value)<BR>

(25) 200 OK<BR>
Body: 25(value)<BR>

(26) 200 OK<BR>
Body: 25(value)<BR>

## A2.4 Set property
The application servient sends a request to set the value to the property of the device servient to the remote proxy servient. The remote and local proxy servient relay to this request to the device servient.

![images](images/seq_setproperty.png)

*Example: using HTTP*

The application puts a value of a certain property of the device servient. For this purpose, it gets the URL for the property from TD of the device servient.

(31) HTTP PUT http://rps.example.com/lps1/Things/deviceName/Property/status<BR>
Body: ON<BR>

The remote proxy puts the URL for the property from TD of the device servient registered in the repository.
"glps.example.com" is global address which can be accessed from remote proxy.

(32) HTTP PUT http://glps.example.com/Things/deviceName/Property/status<BR>
Body: ON<BR>

## A2.5 Subscribe and Event
The application servient sends a request to subscribe the property of the device servient to the remote proxy servient. The device servient keep to send the value of the specified property periodically.

![images](images/seq_subscribe.png)

*Example: using HTTP*

The application subscribes an event of the device servient to be periodically notified. The application gets URL for this event and send a request to the remote proxy servient.

(41) HTTP POST http://rps.example.com/lps1/Things/deviceName/Event/change<BR>
Body: none<BR>

The remote proxy gets the URL for the event from TD of the device servient registered in the repository.

(42) HTTP POST http://glps.example.com/Things/deviceName/Event/change<BR>
Body: none<BR>

The local proxy gets the URL for this event from TD of the device servient registered in the repository.

(43) HTTP POST http://192.169.1.2/Things/deviceName/Event/change<BR>
Body: none<BR>

The device servient sends a notify to the application via the local and remote proxy servient with Server Sent Events specified by W3C.  The device responses “200 OK” with a header “Context-Type: text/event-stream”.

(44)-(46) 200 OK<BR>
Context-Type:text/event-stream<BR>
Body: none<BR>

If this subscription succeeded, the events keep to be notified to the application via the local and remote proxy servients. This event is sent as chunk data.

(47)-(49) <BR>
Body: data:25(value)<BR>

## A2.6 Unsubscribe
The application servient sends a request to unsubscribe to the remote proxy servient to stop to notify the event from the device servient.

![images](images/seq_unsubscribe.png)

*Example: using HTTP*

The application unsubscribes the event “change. The application deletes URL for this event and send a request to the remote proxy servient.

(51) HTTP DELETE http://rps.example.com/lps1/Things/deviceName/Event/change<BR>
Body: none<BR>

The remote proxy gets the URL for the event from TD of the device servient unregistered in the repository.

(52) HTTP DELETE http://glps.example.com/Things/deviceName/Event/change<BR>
Body: none<BR>

The local proxy gets the URL for this event from TD of the device servient unregistered in the repository.

(53) HTTP DELETE http://192.169.1.2/Things/deviceName/Event/change<BR>
Body: none<BR>

The device servient stops sending event and returns the response with “200 OK”.

(54)-(56) 200 OK<BR>
Body: none<BR>

### A2.7 Unregister
The device servient unregister from the local proxy servient before shutdown. The local proxy servient unregister this device servient from the remote proxy not to access from the application.

![images](images/seq_unregister.png)

*Example: using HTTP*

(61) HTTP DELETE http://lps.example.com/Things/deviceName<BR>
Body: none<BR>

(62) 200 OK<BR>

(63) HTTP POST http://rps.example.com/Things/deviceName<BR>
Body: none<BR>

(64) 200 OK<BR>
Body:none<BR>

## A3. Sequence diagrams using WebScoket

Another sequence diagrams to go beyond NAT and firewall is described in this section. WebScoket is used for the connection between remote and local proxy servient. In this case, the local proxy servient creates WebSocket connection to the remote proxy servient and keep it until closing. The messages between the remote and local proxy servients described in session A2 are carried over this WebSocket connection.

### A3.1 Setup a connection
The local proxy servient established a WebSocket connection to the remote proxy servient before beginning interaction between the application and device servients. After the establishment of WebSocket connection, the application can access and control the device via the proxies in the same way described in A2. The following sequence uses WebScoket connection for the NAT traversal instead of STUN described in A2.

![images](images/seq_setup_ws.png)

*Example: using HTTP and WebSocket for NAT traversal*

The local proxy connects to the remote proxy using WebSocket in activating. Then the remote proxy accesses the local proxy through the WebSocket connection.

(71) Create Websocket connection “ws://rps.example.com:WebSocketServerPort/”<BR>
Body: none<BR>

(72) Accept<BR>
Body: none<BR>

The local proxy connects to the remote proxy using WebSocket in activating. Then the remote proxy accesses the local proxy through the WebSocket connection.

(73) Destroy Websocket connection “ws://rps.example.com:WebSocketServerPort/”<BR>
Body: none<BR>

(74) Accept<BR>
Body: none<BR>

### A3.2 Get property
The application servient sends a request to get the value of the property of the device servient to the remote proxy servient. The remote and local proxy servients relay to this request to the device servient using WebSocket connection.

![images](images/seq_getproperty_ws.png)

*Example: using HTTP and WebSocket for NAT traversal*

The remote proxy gets the URI for the property from TD of the device servient registered in the repository. Then the remote proxy sends a message include the URI to the local proxy using WebSocket connection.

(82) send (HTTP GET http://lps.example.com/Things/deviceName/Property/temperature)<BR>

The local proxy sends a message include the value to the remote proxy using WebSocket connection.

(85) send (200 OK, 25(value))<BR>

### A3.3 Set property
The application servient sends a request to set the value to the property of the device servient to the remote proxy servient. The remote and local proxy servients relay to this request to the device servient using WebSocket connection.

![images](images/seq_setproperty_ws.png)

*Example: using HTTP and WebSocket for NAT traversal*

The remote proxy gets the URI for the property from TD of the device servient registered in the repository. Then the remote proxy sends a message include the URI to the local proxy using WebSocket connection.

(92) send (HTTP POST http://lps.example.com/Things/deviceName/Property/status)<BR>

The local proxy sends a message include the value to the remote proxy using WebSocket connection.

(95) send (200 OK)<BR>

### A3.4 Subscribe and Event
The application servient sends a request to subscribe the property of the device servient to the remote proxy servient. The device servient keep to send the value of the specified property periodically and the local proxy servient send the value to the remote proxy servient using WebSocket connection.

![images](images/seq_subscribe_ws.png)

*Example: using HTTP and WebSocket for NAT traversal*
The remote proxy gets the URI for the event from TD of the device servient registered in the repository. Then the remote proxy sends a message include the URI to the local proxy using WebSocket connection.

(102) send (HTTP POST http://lps.example.com/Things/deviceName/Event/change)<BR>

The device servient sends a notify to the application via the local and remote proxy servient with Server Sent Events specified by W3C.  The device responses “200 OK” with a header “Context-Type: text/event-stream”.

(105) send (200 OK, Context-Type:text/event-stream)<BR>

If this subscription succeeded, the events keep to be notified to the application via the local and remote proxy servients. This event is sent as chunk data.

(108) send (data:25(value))<BR>

### A3.5 Unsubscribe
The application servient sends a request to unsubscribe to the remote proxy servient to stop to notify the event from the device servient.

![images](images/seq_unsubscribe_ws.png)

*Example: using HTTP and WebSocket for NAT traversal*
The remote proxy gets the URI for the event from TD of the device servient unregistered in the repository. Then the remote proxy sends a message include the URI to the local proxy using WebSocket connection.
