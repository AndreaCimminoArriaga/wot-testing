# PARTICIPANT PlugFest Result for Lyon 2018

This document summerizes the results of the Lyon PlugFest held Oct 20-22 and 24.

## 3 Checking Points

Test results can have one of 4 states:

* OK: Test passed
* NO: Test failed
   * Use "Issue: ..." to note down the reason
   * Comment if there is a known fix
* OT: Out-of-time to complete test
* NA: Test not applicable, e.g., because feature is not implemented
   * Comment if feature is planned to be implemented in the future

### 3.1 Testing Individually

#### 3.1.1 Validate TDs

##### Panasonic validated all TDs using [Thingweb Playground](https://github.com/thingweb/thingweb-playground)

* OK

#### 3.1.2 Register with Thing Directory

* OT

#### 3.1.3 Connect with Remote/Local Proxy

##### Panasonic proxied Smart Home Things through Proprietery WebSocket connection.

* OK

#### 3.1.4 Connect with node-wot

* NA

### 3.2 Testing in Client Role

To confirm the implementation coverage of each client, see the following tables.

#### Browser WoT Client Test Result against Servients

##### Prerequisite
###### Limitation from Browser WoT Client implementation

- Only supports Content-Type: application/json as payload
- Cannot read file with multiple TDs in array

###### Lmitation from operational environment

- Only Cloud-accesible servients have been tested
- Tested TDs as of 2018/10/20(Sat)

##### Test results

Legends:
- Load: Client could load TD file
- CORS: Client could handle CORS operation (otherwise used non-sec Browser)
- Auth: Client could be authorized to access the endpoint
- interactions: Client could successfully make interactions

#### 3.2.1 Metadata Handling

##### Panasonic used Node-RED and Browser based Generic WoT Client which could consume any Thing metadata with HTTP bindings.
