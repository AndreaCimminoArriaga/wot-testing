## Interoperability Testing

## Demo Scenarios

## Incubation Projects
Aligned with IETF project proposal: [See wiki page](https://www.w3.org/WoT/IG/wiki/F2F_meeting,_13-17_November_2019,_Singapore).
It would be good to focus on topics that are also of interest to IETF members, i.e. CoAP, CoRE resource directories, etc.
