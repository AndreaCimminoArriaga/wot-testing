    Intel supports this specification as it enables interoperation between devices
    from different manufacturers, supporting the growth of an ecosystem of interoperating
    IoT services and easing barriers to adoption.

    Two TD Exposers (Things) were developed and a security proxy were developed, all based on Node.js.
    The Things focused on supporting basic local network access without built-in access controls.
    A separate project, used by all the TD Exposers, provided security (encryption and
    authentication) by means of a reverse proxy.
    For the purposes of counting implementations, the two TD Exposers were considered one
    implementation since they share a significant amount of code.

  Two services based on a shared NodeJS codebase (not using node-wot):
  <ul>
	 <li>A simple camera service that interfaces 
	 with V4L (Video for Linux) to capture still images
         from a USB camera.
	 </li>
	 <li>A simple text-to-speech output service based on espeak.
	 </li>
  </ul>
  </p>

  <h4 id="impl-intel-security">intel-proxy: Intermediary</h4>
  <p>
  This is a reverse proxy service that provides
  authentication (via various mechanisms indicated by the schemes indicated in the Thing
  Description) and encrypted transport (TLS) termination.
  The reverse proxy service was made accessible over a secure tunnel, 
  and depending on the circumstances,
  can be run in the cloud, on a gateway computer, or locally on a device.
