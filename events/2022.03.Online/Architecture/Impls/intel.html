  <p>
  This is a reverse proxy service that provides
  authentication (via various mechanisms indicated by the schemes indicated in the Thing
  Description) and encrypted transport (TLS) termination.
  The reverse proxy service was made accessible over a secure tunnel, 
  and depending on the circumstances,
  can be run in the cloud, on a gateway computer, or locally on a device.

  The secure endpoints provided by this service are not given in TDs for the 
  service itself, but added to the TDs for the Things it services.
