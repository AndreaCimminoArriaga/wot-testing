## Architecture
Collect data for Architecture.
We will use the Architecture implementation report to centralize all
implementation descriptions.

TO DO:
* Use terminology consistent with Architecture's terminology section.
* Unfortunately Exposer/Producer not yet defined per se - under discussion.
* For now suggest: 
    - Exposer - exposes a network interface described by a TD (e.g. a Thing)
    - Producer - creates and makes a TD available (e.g. a tool like edi{TD}or)
    - Discoverer - client-side implementation of WoT Discovery (e.g. Hitachi's node-red prototype)
