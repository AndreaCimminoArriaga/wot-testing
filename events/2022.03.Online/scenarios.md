# PlugFest Scenarios

## Profile Testing
* Oracle simulated devices - using "profile" member (needed for TD testing)
* Need others; property-only devices are relatively easy
* Can later also use these with profile-compliance
    - ECHONET TDs might be candidates, but not in current event
    - But have then from Sept Plugfest last year... should ask if we can use them

## Others

* telemetry use cases:
* TD for a cloud service
* TD for an event listener thing (Consumer)
* digital twins
* scenarios that go beyond the trusted local network scenarios
* industrial scenarios
* battery powered devices
