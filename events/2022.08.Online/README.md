# August 2022 Plugfest
This plugfest is to explore experimental implementations and to discuss application experience, with the 
goal of driving application requirements for the next charter.

Non-WoT members can participate but this is a WoT IG meeting so an agreement to follow the W3C IG rules
is required and a request to participate, including a description of the expected contribution, needs to be 
sent to the WoT Chairs.
