## How to Participate
Most devices and services for the plugfest should have TDs, and these
should follow (and be validated against) the published WoT Thing Description
recommendations.  Exceptions (for example, infrastructure services
such as proxies and directories) should be well-documented.

For Things with TDs, please see the [setup](2020.06.Online/setup.md) 
instructions for how to connect to the VPN and register your TDs.
All TDs need to be validated, archived in github, and (ideally) registered
with a directory service.
