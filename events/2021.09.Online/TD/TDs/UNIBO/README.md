# UNIBO Devices
## General Setup

We provide a set of Thing Descriptions published on a live application: http://arces143100.arces.unibo.it/. The application is a simulated IoT farm deployment called WoT Farm. Currently, there are only two type of devices: SoilSensors and Sprinkles. The TDs are generated starting from Thing Models provided in [TM folder](../../TMs/UNIBO). For your convenience live TDs are also reported here in the `farm` folder. 
Please see the [roadmap](https://github.com/relu91/WoTSimFarm#wot-farm-simulator) for planned future updates. If you have any suggestions or bug to report use the [github issue tracker](https://github.com/relu91/WoTSimFarm/issues). Any contribution is welcomed!
