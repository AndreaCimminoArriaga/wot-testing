# TM Compostion

## Description

The [PR](https://pr-preview.s3.amazonaws.com/w3c/wot-thing-description/pull/1207.html#thing-model-composition) introduces a new feature about Thing Model composition.

During PlugFest, [examples](https://github.com/w3c/wot-testing/tree/main/events/2021.09.Online/TD/TMs/Siemens) were created to gain experience with this modeling concept and to generate TD instances.  

During the vF2F Thing Description session, a short [presentation](https://github.com/w3c/wot/blob/main/PRESENTATIONS/2021-10-online-f2f/2021-10-07-WoT-F2F-TD-Kaebisch.pdf) was provided (slide 7). 

## Result

* so far, the composition feature works quite smoothly
* maybe we can rethink about alternative names for "instanceName"

## Next steps

* composition should be also supported by the ediTDor tool
