# Geolocation

## Participants

* McCool - Intel

## Description

* Ontology for embedding geolocation data in TDs and in Thing
* Example TDs and services
* Geolocation filters in SPARQL
* See Intel TDs and Project

## Discussion

* Need way to distinguish fetching data from a TD itself vs. from an interaction the TD describes
* Problem may also be more general and apply to other kinds of data, e.g. temperature
* May also be other kinds of data that is static vs dynamic, and described by separate thing
* Need to think about JSON pointer syntax related to TD fragment identifier (IANA registered, assuming)
