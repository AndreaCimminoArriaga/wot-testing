# WoT Testing - June 2020 Online Plugfest 
## TD Validation
### Automatic Test Results

The playground validation tool can generate CSV files for each TD that indicates what 
features that TD uses.  
Each organization should put automatic test results for each of their TDs in a subdirectory
here, for example under Org/Thing.csv, where Org is the organization name and 
Thing is the same as the name of the TD to which the test results correspond.
