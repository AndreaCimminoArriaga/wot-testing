# WoT Testing - June 2020 Online Plugfest 
## TD Validation

* [TD validation reports](auto/README.md) The playground
  validation tool can generate CSV files for each TD that indicates what 
  features that TD uses.  
* [template.csv](template.csv): A list of all the features that can be
  included in a final report.  This includes both automatically tested
  and manually asserted features.
* [TD merged validation reports](merged/README.md) For features
  that cannot be automatically tested, manual assertions should be made 
  corresponding to each TD.  These will be given alongside the TDs.
  This directory contains the results of merging the automatic 
  validation results and the manual assertions.  The merged results
  will be used for the final report.
