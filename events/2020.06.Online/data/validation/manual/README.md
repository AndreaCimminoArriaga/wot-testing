# WoT Testing - June 2020 Online Plugfest 
## TD Validation
### Manual Test Results

Not all features can be tested automatically.
Those that cannot are listed in the [template.csv](template.csv) file in this
directory.
Each organization should copy this file for each of their TDs, fill it out, and
put it in a subdirectory
here, for example under Org/Thing.csv, where Org is the organization name and 
Thing is the same as the name of the TD to which the test results correspond.

An organization may also create an Org.csv file if there are results that
are the same for all TDs from that organization.
