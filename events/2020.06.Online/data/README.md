# WoT Testing - June 2020 Online Plugfest 
# Data Capture

During the plugfest, data should be captured in CSV files so that we can
generate a report.  The following types of data should be captured.  Each
type of data has a CSV template which should be used and a subdirectory to
collect contributions.  To avoid merge conflicts, each organization should
set up a subdirectory for their own contributions during the plugfest, then
these will be merged into a single CSV file after the plugfest.

* [TD validation](validation/README.md) Validation data for each TD should
  be recorded here.  This includes both automatic and manual validation data.
* [Implementations](impl/README.md) 
  Information on each implementation should be recorded here, using the 
  provided template.
* [Interoperability tests](interop/README.md) When it has been confirmed that
  two implementations work together, that fact should be noted here.
