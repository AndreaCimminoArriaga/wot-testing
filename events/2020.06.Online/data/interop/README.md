# WoT Testing - June 2020 Online Plugfest 
## Interop Test Results

Place interop results in CSV files under a directory named after the 
contributing organization.  A single or multiple files can be used.
If there are multiple files they will be concatenated.
Use the data schema and naming conventions shown in
[template.csv](template.csv).

## TODO
* Expand template to capture more detail on interop tests.
* Another set of columns to capture which protocol and operation type were tested.
