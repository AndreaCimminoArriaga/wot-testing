00:06.000 --> 00:10.000
Node-RED, the well-known low-code development tool from the OpenJS Foundation,

00:10.000 --> 00:12.500
supports the Web of Things Thing Description

00:12.500 --> 00:17.400
as part of the Node Generator project to simplify the development of Node-RED nodes.

00:17.500 --> 00:23.000
In this demo, we'll show you how to automatically populate Things in the Node-RED's editor screen. 

00:23.300 --> 00:25.000
This is a Node-RED editor.

00:25.000 --> 00:30.000
With Node-RED, you can create applications by connecting boxes, called 'nodes'.

00:30.000 --> 00:32.000
Let's import a Thing into the palette on the left side.

00:32.500 --> 00:36.000
To import a Thing, use the palette manager.

00:36.000 --> 00:39.000
On this screen, you can see a list of all the Things you've discovered.

00:39.000 --> 00:41.000
There are currently two Things.

00:41.000 --> 00:43.500
As you update, you will find more new Things.

00:43.500 --> 00:47.500
You can enter keywords to narrow down the types of Things you want to add to your palette.

00:47.500 --> 00:51.500
If you type "coffee", you'll see that there are two coffee machines.

00:51.500 --> 00:55.000
Let's try installing one of them.

01:00.000 --> 01:05.000
After the installation is complete, you will see a node on the left side of the palette.

01:05.000 --> 01:08.500
Let's take a look at the state of the coffee machine using this node.

01:08.500 --> 01:11.500
Select a node from the palette and incorporate it into the flow.

01:11.500 --> 01:15.000
Double-click on the node to bring up the configuration screen.

01:15.000 --> 01:18.700
Here you can configure the interaction to the Thing when it receives a message.

01:18.700 --> 01:23.500
You can get the state of the coffee machine by selecting 'Property', 'state', and 'Read'.

01:27.000 --> 01:30.000
Now, let's try out the completed flow.

01:30.000 --> 01:32.500
Press the 'deploy' button to start running it.

01:32.500 --> 01:36.000
You can access the Thing and get its state by sending a message to the Thing's nodes.

01:39.000 --> 01:42.000
If you go back to the palette management interface again, ...

01:49.000 --> 01:53.000
... this time you can see the 20 Things.

01:53.000 --> 01:57.000
You can enter a variety of keywords to search for even more new Things.

02:09.000 --> 02:18.000
In this way, you can easily create IoT applications by using Node-RED to import real-world 'Things' described in Thing Descriptions and stitch them together.
