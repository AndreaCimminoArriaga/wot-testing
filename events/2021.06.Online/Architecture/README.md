# Testing for Architecture
Note: may not be actual tests, but there should be an implementation.
Perhaps we can centralize the implementation descriptions in this report and just refer to them from the others.
This report will then be used to organize and index the other reports.
There may be a small table of assertions but these can be manually asserted by the implementors.
