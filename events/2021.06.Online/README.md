# June 2021 Testfest

## Logistics
* Previous testfests and plugfests
    - https://github.com/w3c/wot-testing/tree/main/events
* Wiki (includes schedule and webexes)
    - https://www.w3.org/WoT/IG/wiki/F2F_meeting,_June_2021#Testfest

## Data and Results
* [Architecture](Architecture)
* [Profiles](Profiles)
* [Discovery](Discovery)
* [Thing Description](TD)
    
## To Do:
* DONE: Link previous testfest 
* DONE: Link to webex, schedule, etc. logistics (e.g. in wiki) 
* DONE (directories created): Organize by deliverable
    - Thing Description 1.1
    - Discovery
    - Profiles
    - Architecture
* Define what an implementation is
    - Per deliverable
    - Can use previous discussion (eg Princeton testfest) as a starting point
    - Profiles
         - Does a implementation (e.g. node-wot) always need to check that a TD satisfies the profile constraints?
* Describe implementations
    - Per deliverable
    - In each source repo...
* Collect data for each implementation
    - Collecting TDs
    - Tests (eg output files) for discovery
        - Directory services
        - Peer-to-Peer services (manual testing possible...)
        - Introduction services (manual testing... necessary?)
* Describe testing plan
    - Look at last year's CR transition request for format and previous version
* Index testing tools
* Index report generation tools
* Organize outputs
    - Testing plan for each deliverable
    - Draft implementation report for each deliverable
    - Identification of testing gaps
    - Identification of implementation gaps -> at risk feature markup

## Other work
* Updating and generalizing the report generation scripts
* Updating the TD playground
* Capturing automated tests for directories
