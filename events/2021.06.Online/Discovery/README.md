# Discovery Testing



## Types of implementations

These are all the types of discovery implementations. Each implementation from the group would correspond to one or more of the listed types below

In all types of implementations, there can be Consumer (subject to change, it is the entity that finds a TD) and Producer (subject to change, it is the entity that register/advertise a TD).

### Introduction mechanism

How a TD can be found without relying on a TD directory.

- Network level
  - Core RD : 
  - MDNS
  - URL
  - Direct method (QR Code or similar)
  - DID (no implementations so far)

### Exploration mechanisms

How a TD can be found by relying on a TD directory.

- Directory:
  - SPARQL
  - JSON Path
  - XPath

## Implementations

The sections below can be externalized into MD files per implementation
