# What is an Implementation
Description of what an implementation is goes here, what categories there are, and how many we need of each.

TODO: copy initial version out of last year's implementation report.

## Producers
Need at least 2.
* node-wot
* WebThings
* random Things

## Consumers
Need at least 2.
* node-wot
* WebThings?

## Processors and Validators
Process TDs but may not invoke interactions.  Example: Directory service, JSON Schema validator.
Do not necessarily count as implementations (e.g. if they only validate or store TDs, but don't invoke interactions, they would not count).
