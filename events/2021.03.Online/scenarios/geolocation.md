# Geolocation Scenario

Theme/use case: Smart City Dashboard

Extend previous work by @dape using OpenMaps (https://github.com/w3c/wot-testing/issues/76)

* Read TDs (pull out of Directory service)
* Place them on a map (e.g. OpenMaps) automatically.  
* Use standard geolocation info (see https://github.com/mmccool/wot-discovery/blob/geolocation-proposal/proposals/geolocation.md)
* Support static geolocation information
* Support dynamic geolocation information
* Support separate geolocation tracking device
* Support FOI vs. sensor location
