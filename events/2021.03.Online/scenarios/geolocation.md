# Geolocation Scenario

Theme/use case: Smart City Dashboard

Extend previous work by @dape using OpenMaps (link to issue)

Read TDs, and place them on a map automatically.  
* Use standard geolocation info (see https://github.com/mmccool/wot-discovery/blob/geolocation-proposal/proposals/geolocation.md)
* Support both dynamic and static
