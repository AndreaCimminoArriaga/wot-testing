# WebThings Contribution

## producedByGateway Folder
This directory contains a snapshot of Thing Descriptions generated by the [Virtual Things Adapter](https://github.com/WebThingsIO/virtual-things-adapter/) of [WebThings Gateway](https://github.com/WebThingsIO/gateway/), which showcases the capabilities from the WebThings [schema repository](https://webthings.io/schemas/). These same schemas are used by around 100 gateway [add-ons](https://api.webthings.io:8443/addons/info) which expose real smart home devices (using a variety of different smart home protocols such as Zigbee, Z-Wave and HomeKit) to the Web of Things.

The Thing Descriptions in this directory are generated by the current master branch of WebThings Gateway at the time of the PlugFest, which is in the process of being modified to be W3C compliant. The current set of TDs therefore do not validate as valid W3C WoT Thing Descriptions. The [w3c-compliance](https://github.com/WebThingsIO/gateway/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aw3c-compliance) label in the issue tracker tracks remaining known W3C compliance issues which are yet to be resolved. Please report any other compliance issues you discover in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/WebThingsIO/gateway/issues).

For an overview of the current known compliance of WebThings with the W3C WoT Thing Description 1.1, WoT Profile and WoT Discovery specifications, please see the [March 2022 WebThings W3C Compliance Report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NmoZ61iVEfIw6rhRwsCwTrq__eN137ROHzJjobWNPZo/edit?usp=sharing).


## TDs folder

These TDs are edited by hand by @egekorkan to match the spec. The only modificaiton is the `@context` field

## Live Instance

A live instance of the gateway web interface can be accessed during the plugfest at https://plugfest.webthings.io. Please see the WoT Working Group members mailing list for a username and password.

You can get a token for API access via OAuth2 by authenticating with the username and password, as per the security metadata in the Thing Descriptions, or by manually setting a `Bearer` token in an `Authorization` header. Please see the WoT Working Group members mailing list for an example token.

Please note that you must add an `Accept` header with a value of `application/json` for API requests as shown in the example below, because the default response is an HTML representation.

An example curl command is provided below (requires replacing [token] with a valid token).

```
curl --location --request GET 'https://plugfest.webthings.io/things/virtual-things-6/properties/on' --header 'Accept: application/json' --header 'Authorization: Bearer [token]'
```
