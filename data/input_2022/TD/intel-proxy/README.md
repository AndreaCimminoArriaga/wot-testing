# Intel - Online Testfest March 2022

### Reverse Cloud Proxy
Several Things provided by Intel support security mechanisms via a cloud proxy.
This proxy supports connection over a secure SSH tunnel and then re-expose
a new endpoint supporting TLS and additional authentication mechanisms.

When accessing a Thing via the cloud proxy, use the credentials, linked below, 
for "wotbasicproxy" or "wodigestproxy" based on whether you are using
basic or digest authentication.
For simplicity we are using the same credentials for all services, although
in a real deployment it would be better to have unique credentials for all
services.

* [Proxy Authentication Credentials](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/member-wot-ig/2018May/0003.html)

W3C WoT membership is required to access these credentials.
Please do not repost them in a public forum
(for example,
do not check the keys into a public github repo as part of a test suite,
post on a forum,
share in a public messaging system, etc).
These will be updated periodically so if an access does not work,
check that you have the latest version.
