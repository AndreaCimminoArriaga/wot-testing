# Test Results for WoT Discovery Implementations
Test results should go into CSV files that will be used to generate an implementation report.
Note that implementation descriptions should go into Architecture.

TO DO:
* List of assertions and template for CSV file (McCool)
* Draft implementation report (McCool)
* Organize results for different implementations and discoverer, directory, self-description, and introduction categories.
   - A subdirectory per organization
   - Example needed
